Angular Project Assignment Retake
Your task is to design and implement a web application (Single Page Application) using Angular. Use a service like Kinvey or Firebase for your back-end or create your own with Node.js and MongoDB or a framework in another language (ASP.NET, Spring, Symfony). It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application of your choice.
Note: The back-end part of your project must function properly, but it will NOT be considered during the exam. This is a front-end course and only the front-end part will be assessed.

1.	Submission Deadline
•	You must submit a link to your project before 23:59h on 18-Aug-2025 using a survey that will show up on 05-Aug-2025.
•	You can continue working on your project until the end of 20-Aug-2025 (23:59h).
•	A presentation schedule will be available on 21-Aug-2025 and will include only the projects submitted beforehand. Non-submitted projects will NOT be evaluated.

2.	Application Structure
The application should have:
•	Public Part (Accessible without authentication)
•	Private Part (Available for Registered Users)
1.1 Public Part
The public part of your projects should be visible without authentication. This public part could be the application start page, the user login, and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g., the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.
1.2 Private Part (User Area)
Registered users should have a personal area in the web application accessible after successful login. This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo-sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.
Note: A logged-in user should stay logged-in after refreshing the page.

3.	General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks, and development techniques:
•	At least 4 different dynamic pages: pages that render dynamic data (pages like about, contacts, login, register, create, etc. do NOT count towards that figure)
•	Must have specific views:
o	Catalog – list of all created records
o	Details – information about a specific record
•	At least one collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
o	Logged-in users should be able to create records (by sending requests to the REST API) and interact with those records (via likes, dislikes, comments, etc.)
o	Logged-in users should be able to edit and delete their own records
o	A guest user should have access to basic website information (catalog, details), but not to the functional activities
•	Use Angular for the client-side
•	Communicate to a remote service (via REST, sockets, GraphQL, or a similar client-server technique)
•	Implement client-side routing to at least 4 pages (at least 1 with parameters)
•	Meaningful commits with descriptive commit messages to a source control system like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc., for at least 3 days
•	The GitHub repository must be public.
IMPORTANT: If your project doesn't cover these conditions, you will not be graded!

4.	Other requirements
•	Apply error handling (conditional rendering based on error response) and data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered
•	Use appropriate folder structure
•	Brief documentation describing the project (used frameworks and libraries, how to run it, functionality, architecture) as .md file
•	Demonstrate use of the following programming concepts, specific to the Angular framework:
o	TypeScript with specific types (avoid the type "any")
o	at least 2 interfaces
o	observables
o	at least 2 RxJS operators
o	lifecycle hooks
o	pipes
•	Component Styling (use at least some external CSS files)
•	Implement route guards for the private AND the public part: guest users shouldn‘t be able to access private pages, logged-in users shouldn‘t be able to see the login/register pages
•	Interact with the records (via likes, dislikes, comments, etc.) by sending requests to the REST API
•	Good usability. Good UI and UX (You can follow the Design Best Practice guide)

5.	Bonuses
•	Deploy the application in a cloud environment.
•	Use a file storage cloud API, e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive or other for storing the files.
•	Use of features of HTML 5 like Geolocation, SVG, Canvas, etc.
•	Use Angular Animations somewhere in your application.
•	Write unit tests for your components.
•	Use RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux (ngRx store)
•	Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use. 
Note: You will NOT receive any bonus points for back-end customizations!

6.	Public Project Defense
Each student will have to deliver a public defense of their work in front of the other students, trainers, and assistants. Students will have 20 minutes for the following:
•	Demonstrate how the application works (very shortly)
•	Show the source code and explain how it works
•	Show any bonus functionalities they have implemented
•	Answer questions

Please be strict in the timing! On the 10th minute, your presentation ends. The remaining time will be for a question-and-answer session.
Be well prepared to present the maximum of your work for the minimum amount of time. Open the project assets beforehand to save time.
The project defense will be happening online through Discord.

7.	Assessment Criteria
General Requirements – 30 %
Implementing all the general requirements will grant you a place on the defense schedule. All projects that do not have the general requirements will not be accepted for defense.
Other Requirements – 45 % 
Functionality Presentation – 5 %
Adequately demonstrate the requested functionality. Know your way around the application and quickly demonstrate the code.
Answering Questions – 20 %
Answer questions about potential functionality outside the scope of the project.
Bonuses – up to 10 %
Additional functionality or libraries outside the general requirements, with motivated usage.

8.	Restrictions
You can use parts (some components, routing configurations, form validation, etc...) of the course workshop, but you are NOT allowed to use the whole workshop as your project assignment. You are NOT allowed to use HTML & CSS structures from any SoftUni course.
9.	Project Challenge
The best three projects will win a discount for the next course or module:
•	First place – 80% discount voucher
•	Second place – 50% discount voucher
•	Third place – 30% discount voucher
